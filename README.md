Step 1 - Install Git on your local machine and create a GitHub account (if you do not already
have one).

Step 3 - Choose one classmate (you may find a collaborator during the tutorial or before) and
add them as a Collaborator on your GitHub repository.
Step 4 - Create a new branch in your repository.
Step 5 - Add a new file to your repository (for example, a text file or Python file, which prints
your first and last names).
Step 6 - Commit the new file with a clear message (e.g., “Added sample file for tutorial”).
Step 7- Push the new branch to GitHub.
Step 8 - Create a Pull Request (PR) and assign your collaborator as the Reviewer.
Step 9 - Wait for your collaborator to review and approve your PR.
Step 10: Once approved, merge the new branch into the main (master) branch.
Congratulations — you’ve completed your first Git collaboration workflow!
